## Motivation

I wanted to create music application to practice and listen to some of my favorite music through an application I've built. I hope you enjoyed the songs.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To run application on your local machine follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project from the [repository](https://github.com/777pretty/ixmusic).
2. Install both backend and frontend dependencies with this one command:

   ```bash
   # with npm
   npm run iall

   # or with yarn
   yarn run iall
   ```

3. Create new file named ".env" at the root of the project folder.

4. Add this environmental variable to the .env file you've just created with the value of your MongoDB URI:
   ```javascript
   MONGODB_URI = "your-mongodb-uri";
   ```
5. Start development mode with command:

   ```bash
   # with npm
   npm run dev

   # or with yarn
   yarn run dev
   ```

6. Run the application in the browser with url:
   ```javacript
   localhost:3000
   ```

### Usage

To use the application press play button. Press arrow symbols to change song or click on a song in the playlist. The playlist can be opened with the drawer button in the top right corner.
